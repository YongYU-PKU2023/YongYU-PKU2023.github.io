## Project Experience

- **Simulation Dataset for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles with Hybrid Communication and Multimodal Perception**\
  *Duration: September 2022 - Present*\
  Description:
  - Developed and curated a comprehensive simulation dataset for connected and autonomous vehicles with hybrid communication and multimodal perception.
  - Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to collect and synthesize data from various sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and V2X communication devices.
  - Designed realistic traffic scenarios and generated ground truth annotations for training and evaluation of perception and communication algorithms.
  - The dataset and associated research findings were published in the following paper: [Your Dataset Paper Title](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14125)

- **Automatic Tracking Camera System for Targeted Individuals based on Raspberry Pi Development Board**\
  *Duration: December 2021 - October 2022*\
  Description:
  - Developed a Yolov5+Kalman filter algorithm for multi-person scene tracking, enabling differentiation and labeling of different targets.
  - Implemented a client-server (C/S) architecture using Raspberry Pi and a computer due to the limited computational power of Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi captured camera data and transmitted it as MJPG streams to the computer for processing.
  - Established communication through socket communication between the development board, computer, and a mobile app, allowing for instructions to be transmitted. Collaborated with team members to develop a mobile app for selecting target individuals.
  - Utilized a PID algorithm for flexible real-time tracking of moving targets, enabling instant capturing of images.

- **Conference System based on Hisilicon AI Computer Vision Development Kit**\
  *Duration: May 2022 - July 2022*\
  Description:
  - Designed an algorithm for face recognition and trained the model using open-source datasets. Converted the model using pytorch-caffe and deployed the quantized model file to the board.
  - Utilized the Hisilicon NNIE (Neural Network Inference Engine) API interface for the inference module, enabling the calling of model files and real-time video inference from the camera.
  - Established communication between the vision board and WiFi-loT board using a serial communication protocol. The WiFi-loT board processed the received target coordinate positions from the vision board and utilized a PID control algorithm to achieve real-time tracking of faces.
